| Extreme environments | YES | No | No | Partial | No | No |

## When to Choose ProofPack

**Choose ProofPack when:**
- Operating in environments with unreliable connectivity
- Regulatory compliance is critical (FDA, financial, defense)
- Need audit trail for autonomous decision-making
- Want economic integration without ZK infrastructure
- Privacy controls beyond all-or-nothing

**Consider alternatives when:**
- Sub-millisecond latency is critical (Hackett)
- ZK payment proofs are required (Brevis)
- Gaming/consumer application (Miden)
- Existing dispute resolution needs (idOS)
- Consumer finance focus (MorphLayer)

## Our Unique Position

> "Receipts-native governance infrastructure for systems that can't call home."

No competitor occupies this space:
- Hackett: Fast but assumes connectivity
- Brevis: Payments but assumes connectivity
- Miden: Offline but gaming/consumer focus
- idOS: Disputes but assumes connectivity
- MorphLayer: Standard but consumer finance focus

**We own:** Offline + Governance + Extreme Environments

## The Pitch

> "When your satellite makes an autonomous decision 400km above Earth, it can't ask permission. It generates a receipt locally, builds a Merkle proof in isolation, and syncs when it sees ground station. That's ProofPack. Governance for systems that can't call home."

*They build for connectivity. We build for isolation. That's the wedge.*
