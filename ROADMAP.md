## Success Metrics

| Milestone | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|
| Working group members | 5 | 7 | 10 | 15 |
| GitHub stars (combined) | 50 | 200 | 500 | 1000 |
| Pilots (LOIs) | 2 | 5 | 10 | 15 |
| Production deployments | 0 | 1 | 5 | 10 |
| Compliance (X/6) | 6 | 6 | 6 | 6 |
| Test coverage | 50% | 80% | 90% | 95% |

---

## Series A Milestones (2026)

**Target:** 20+ production deployments, 1000+ GitHub stars, working group self-sustaining

**Focus:** Revenue ramp, ecosystem partnerships, category ownership

---

## What Won't Change

**Core commitments (non-negotiable):**
- Receipts-native architecture
- Dual-hash cryptographic proofs
- Open working group governance
- Zero trust required (verify everything)
- StopRule on violations

**These define the category. No compromise.**

---

## How to Contribute

See [standards/CONTRIBUTE.md](standards/CONTRIBUTE.md)

**High-impact areas:**
- Test coverage (P0)
- Security audit support (P0)
- CI/CD pipeline (P0)
- Reference implementations (P1)
- Documentation (P1)

**Join the working group:** First meeting Feb 2025

## Dependencies

| Dependency | Risk | Mitigation |
|------------|------|------------|
| Seed funding | High | Working group can proceed without |
| Security auditor | Medium | Multiple options, budget TBD |
| Pilot customers | Medium | Government + FSD channels active |
| Community contributors | Low | Core team can execute solo |

---

## Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2024-12-31 | Research-grade honest framing | Transparency builds trust |
| 2024-12-31 | 6/6 compliance target | Full RNES alignment |
| 2024-12-31 | Q2 2025 enterprise target | Post-seed runway |
| 2025-01-01 | Enterprise Integration v1.0 | CLAUDEME §12-14 compliance |
